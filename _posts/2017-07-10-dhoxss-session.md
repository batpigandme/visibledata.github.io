We ran a short Data Carpentry taster as part of a session on Reproducible Research
at the annual [Digital Humanities Oxford Summer School](http://www.dhoxss.net). This 
part of the An Introduction to Digitial Humanities strand. It took place on Wednesday 
July 5th at 11:00 to 12:30 with around 40 attendees.  

The material covered a brief overview of git with some Python, developed from Data and 
Software Carpentry material. The material forms the basis for the planned [September
workshop](/2017-08-08-workshop-announcement/).

We ran our first successful <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/"
target="_blank">Software Carpentry</a> workshop on January 9--10, 2017
at <a href="http://torch.ox.ac.uk/" target="_blank">TORCH</a>. The <a
href="https://rroxford.github.io/2017-01-09-oxford/"
target="_blank">workshop</a> covered bash, git, and python, with
sessions led by instructors <a href="../../philip-fowler"
target="_blank">Philip Fowler</a> and <a href="../../iain-emsley"
target="_blank">Iain Emsley</a>.

We had ~25 participants drawn from across the University, including
researchers, staff, and students, and covering disciplines in the
natural, medical, and social sciences, and in the humanities. More
successful workshops to come!

We had a busy Hilary Term 2017, and we are now gearing up for new
workshops and related activities in Trinity Term 2017 and beyond!

In Hilary Term we ran two <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/"
target="_blank">Software Carpentry</a> workshops, one in <a
href="https://rroxford.github.io/2017-01-09-oxford/"
target="_blank">January</a> and one <a
href="https://rroxford.github.io/2017-03-13-oxford/"
target="_blank">March</a>. So far, we have provided training to over
50 learners from across the University, in bash, git, and programming
in python or R.

In March, we hosted the first Oxford-based Software/Data Carpentry <a
href="https://steve-crouch.github.io/2017-03-16-oxford-ttt/"
target="_blank">instructor training</a>. 11 Oxford-based trainees were
joined by colleagues from UCL and the University of Sheffield for two
days of intensive training for teaching. This is part of our effort to
build local capacity in the area of effective computing for
reproducibility. The trainee instructors join a small cohort of
instructors already based at Oxford, and they will be able to deliver
training at future workshops.

We are now planning a series of workshops for the coming months ---

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(collapse = TRUE)
```

After a long time coming, I've finally got round to picking a workable solution for creating my data blog "Visible Data". This is a short overview of how I picked my tools and my intentions for the website.

I had three core requirements:

- I could write the blog in RMarkdown
- I could easily include `htmlwidgets` in blogposts (and elsewhere)
- I could use Bootstrap grids wherever I fancied (I'm obsessed with responsive grids)

## RMarkdown

Previously I made use of Dean Attali's awesome [Beautiful Jekyll](https://deanattali.com/beautiful-jekyll/) theme for creating a static website website hosted on GitHub Pages. I'd thoroughly recommend this for creating a very quick website where you **don't** need RMarkdown because GitHub's Jekyll builder doesn't support it at all. 

There are a few websites I contribute to that still use Beautiful Jekyll, including the excellent [Reproducible Research Oxford Project](rroxford.github.io) which runs [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/) training courses to encourage reproducible research methodologies.

The simplest solution for creating a blog which allows us to write content in RMarkdown is the excellent `blogdown` package, which is thoroughly introduced in Yihui Xie et al's freely available book [blogdown: Creating Websites with R Markdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/).

## htmlwidgets

I love `htmlwidgets` and think they're criminally under

## Replicate this site {.replicate-this-blog}

This website uses the wonderful [Hugo Universal Theme](https://github.com/devcows/hugo-universal-theme) and was built using the following steps (a slightly tailored version of the workflow in Yihui's book, [**do read the book**](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/))

1. Create a new RStudio Project (if you're not using RStudio projects, [you really should be](https://www.lynda.com/R-tutorials/Why-should-you-use-projects-RStudio/586672/648981-4.html))
1. Initialise a git repo with `usethis::usethis::use_git()`
1. Run `blogdown::new_site(theme = 'devcows/hugo-universal-theme')`
1. In the `config.toml` file make the following changes:
    + Item 3a
    + Item 3b

Are you passionate about reproducibility and open research? There are
several ways to get involved, from attending a [workshop](events.md)
to joining the [project team](about.md)! We are also looking for
volunteers to help out with the workshops, as host, helper, and/or
instructor.

Are you interested in running a Software/Data Carpenty workshop for
your research group or department? Then get in touch to discuss how we
may be able to help.

For announcements about future workshops and related activities, check
our [events](events.md) page, subscribe to our [mailing
list](https://web.maillist.ox.ac.uk/ox/info/rroxford), and follow us
on Twitter [@RR_Oxford](https://twitter.com/RR_Oxford). Email us at <a
